# Self-introduction
Hey, guys! I'm Vinson, a middle school student from China. This is my first time using Github, so it's necessary to make a self-introduction. 

My hobbies
 - Playing Drums:🥁:

 - Using Computers:💻:

 - Reseach Cars:🚗:

 - etc...

In addition, it is not easy for me to code a program, because it was my first time learning C++ and vscode, so could you please be patient? Thanks for your understanding!
